# Phase 16: Offers and Profile Screens Implementation

## Overview
Phase 16 completes the core React Native mobile app functionality by implementing the Offers system and Profile management screens. This phase integrates real API data for offers, implements comprehensive user profile management, and adds persistent settings storage.

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ Completed Features

#### 1. Offers Screen Enhancement
- **Real API Integration**: Connected to backend offers endpoints using RTK Query
- **Featured Offers Carousel**: Horizontal scroll view for promoted deals
- **Category Filtering**: Filter offers by shop categories
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: Refresh offers data with loading states
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and retry mechanisms
- **Loading States**: Progressive loading indicators for better UX

#### 2. Profile Screen Implementation
- **User Authentication Simulation**: Mock login/logout functionality
- **Settings Persistence**: AsyncStorage integration for user preferences
- **Favorites Integration**: Real-time favorites count and navigation
- **Comprehensive Settings**: Notifications, language, theme preferences
- **Mall Information**: Contact details and support information
- **App Information**: Version details and about section

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Offers Screen Updates (`src/screens/Offers/OffersScreen.tsx`)
```typescript
// Real API data fetching
const { 
  data: offersData, 
  isLoading: offersLoading, 
  error: offersError,
  refetch: refetchOffers 
} = useGetOffersQuery({ 
  category: selectedCategory !== 'all' ? selectedCategory : undefined,
  featured: false 
});

const { 
  data: featuredData, 
  isLoading: featuredLoading, 
  error: featuredError 
} = useGetFeaturedOffersQuery();

// Category-based filtering
const filteredOffers = selectedCategory === 'all' 
  ? offers 
  : offers.filter(offer => offer.category === selectedCategory);
```

#### Profile Screen Features (`src/screens/Profile/ProfileScreen.tsx`)
```typescript
// Settings persistence with AsyncStorage
const saveSettings = async (newSettings: any) => {
  try {
    const currentSettings = {
      notifications: notificationsEnabled,
      darkMode,
      language,
      isLoggedIn,
      ...newSettings,
    };
    await AsyncStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEYS.SETTINGS, JSON.stringify(currentSettings));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error saving settings:', error);
  }
};

// Favorites integration
const favoritesCount = useAppSelector(state => state.favorites.shopIds.length);
```

### Files Modified/Created

#### Updated Files
1. **`src/screens/Offers/OffersScreen.tsx`**
   - Replaced mock data with real API calls
   - Added comprehensive loading and error states
   - Implemented pull-to-refresh functionality
   - Enhanced category filtering with real data

2. **`src/screens/Profile/ProfileScreen.tsx`**
   - Added AsyncStorage integration for settings persistence
   - Integrated Redux state for favorites management
   - Enhanced user authentication simulation
   - Added comprehensive mall information and support

3. **`src/types/index.ts`**
   - Added `SETTINGS` key to `STORAGE_KEYS` for profile preferences

### Redux Integration

#### Offers Data Flow
```typescript
// RTK Query endpoints used
- useGetOffersQuery: Fetch all offers with optional category filter
- useGetFeaturedOffersQuery: Fetch featured/promoted offers
- useGetShopsQuery: Fetch shop data for offer display
```

#### Profile State Management
```typescript
// AsyncStorage keys used
- STORAGE_KEYS.SETTINGS: User preferences and authentication state
- STORAGE_KEYS.FAVORITES: Synced with Redux favorites slice

// Redux selectors used
- state.favorites.shopIds.length: Real-time favorites count
```

### User Experience Enhancements

#### Offers Screen
- **Loading States**: Progressive loading for featured and regular offers
- **Error Recovery**: Clear error messages with retry functionality
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no offers are available
- **Category Filtering**: Smooth filtering with immediate visual feedback
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: Intuitive refresh mechanism for fresh data

#### Profile Screen
- **Settings Persistence**: All preferences saved automatically
- **Visual Feedback**: Immediate confirmation for setting changes
- **Comprehensive Organization**: Logical grouping of settings by category
- **Mall Integration**: Relevant mall information and contact details
- **Logout Protection**: Confirmation dialog with data loss warning

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Efficient Data Loading**: Conditional API calls based on user interactions
2. **AsyncStorage Optimization**: Batched setting updates to reduce I/O
3. **State Management**: Proper Redux integration to avoid unnecessary re-renders
4. **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of async operations

### Error Handling & Edge Cases

1. **Network Failures**: Graceful error states with retry options
2. **Data Inconsistency**: Fallback displays for missing shop information
3. **Storage Errors**: Console logging with graceful degradation
4. **State Synchronization**: Proper handling of logout data clearing

### Testing Considerations

1. **API Integration**: Mock data service provides reliable testing environment
2. **AsyncStorage**: Settings persistence tested across app restarts
3. **State Management**: Redux integration properly tested with real actions
4. **User Flows**: Complete authentication and settings flows verified
